# BIOMI-6200-Final
A final presentation detailing the uses of Github as a project management resource for scientists

**Welcome everybody** to my final project for BIOMI 6200. Here I will focus on the project management abilities as I think they will be the most useful in your graduate school adventures. 

There are a number of other great uses for Github, so I will cover the basics before I get to the project management stuff. 

### What is Github?

> Github is a service that hosts code and allows developers to collaborate together on a project using the Git version control system

### What is Git?

> A very detailed version control program, that is the backbone of Github, but can be used independantly on any computer that can download it. Here is my favorite [introductory tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) to the basics.

### Your buy in

Github is already ubiquitous in the software development world, why should you, as biologists be interested in using this as your main project management resources?

Here are a few reasons:
* You can be incredibly detailed, or high level in your "issues" 
* You can collaborate with anyone who has an internet connection
* You can allow anyone to contribute to your projects (even [via email](https://fire.fundersclub.com/) if you want)
* Every step in your project can be timed, and even automatically brought to your attention when you need to complete them
* You can easily access your previous versions
* Any coding can be done via Copilot
* Everything you need for a publication can be hosted in one area
* A million and a half more reasons

As we walk through Github, feel free to ask any questions, or better yet, find this repository and make a pull request/add a comment/otherwise interact. 

The best way to learn is to do! :)
